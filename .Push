HASHES AND SYMBOLS
Converting Between Symbols and Strings
Converting between strings and symbols is a snap.

:sasquatch.to_s
# ==> "sasquatch"

"sasquatch".to_sym
# ==> :sasquatch
The .to_s and .to_sym methods are what you're looking for!

Instructions
1.
We have an array of strings we'd like to later use as hash keys, but we'd rather they be symbols.
Create a new variable, symbols, and store an empty array in it.
Use .each to iterate over the strings array.
For each s in strings, use .to_sym to convert s to a symbol and use .push to add that new symbol to symbols.
Print the symbols array.
Check the hint for a refresher on .each and .push.

You can use .each to loop through an array. Remember, the .push method allows you to add an element to the end of an array!





strings = ["HTML", "CSS", "JavaScript", "Python", "Ruby"]
symbols = []

strings.each { |s| 
 symbols.push(s.to_sym) }
print symbols
